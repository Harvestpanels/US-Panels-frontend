// .pipedriveWebForms div with a <script> inside it. That snippet cannot be
// dropped into JSX as-is — React never executes a <script> tag it renders,
// so the form would silently never appear.
//
// The loader also only scans the document for containers at the moment it
// executes, and this is a single-page app where <Contact> mounts and
// unmounts on every route change. A script loaded once on the first page
// would not pick up the container rendered on the next one. So the whole
// snippet is built imperatively here, per mount: a fresh <script> element
// re-executes the loader (the file itself is served from cache) and it finds
// this instance's container.
//
// The host div stays empty in JSX and React never owns anything inside it —
// the container and script are created and torn down here. Letting React
// render children that the third-party loader then replaces with its iframe
// would leave React trying to remove nodes that are no longer its own.
