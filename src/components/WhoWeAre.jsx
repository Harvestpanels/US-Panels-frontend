// Desktop gets the navy-fill hover effect (see #why .hp-card:hover in
// WhoWeAre.css) for free via :hover. Touch devices have no hover, so tap
// drives the same effect instead — via a class on an *inner* wrapper, not
// on this card itself. This card is also where registerReveal's ref and
// .hp-reveal live for the scroll-in animation; toggling a class directly
// on it would change its own className string on every tap, and React
// fully replaces an element's className on any string change — silently
// wiping the "is-visible" class registerReveal's IntersectionObserver had
// added *imperatively* (via classList.add, outside React's own
// tracking), reading as the whole card fading out the moment it's
// tapped. (Exactly the bug already hit and fixed once for the membership
// cards' tap-to-flip — same root cause, same fix.) The inner wrapper
// carries the "is-active" marker instead, and the CSS uses `:has()` to
// style the outer card based on that inner marker, so the outer
// element's own className never needs to change at all.
